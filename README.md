# SA_language_Hackathon

Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of identifying South African languages from text data. The dataset comprises text samples labeled with their respective languages, including Afrikaans, English, isiXhosa, isiZulu, and others. The goal is to preprocess the data, train a model, and evaluate its performance to achieve high accuracy in language classification.

Objectives

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the text data for modeling.

Feature Engineering: Transform text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning.

Model Training: Implement and train various machine learning models.

Evaluation: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.

Optimization: Tune model parameters to improve accuracy.

Methodology
1. Data Loading and Exploration

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file containing text samples and their corresponding language labels. Initial exploration involves checking for missing values and understanding the distribution of languages in the dataset.

2. Text Preprocessing

Text data undergoes several preprocessing steps:

Lowercasing: Convert all text to lowercase to maintain uniformity.

Tokenization: Split text into individual words or tokens.

Stopword Removal: Eliminate common words (e.g., 'the', 'and') that do not contribute significant meaning.

Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root form.

3. Feature Extraction

Text data is transformed into numerical features using techniques such as:

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Measures the importance of a word in a document relative to its frequency across all documents.

Word Embeddings: Represents words in a continuous vector space capturing semantic meaning.

4. Model Training

Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated:

Logistic Regression: A linear model for binary classification tasks.

Random Forest: An ensemble method that constructs multiple decision trees.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): A model that finds the hyperplane that best separates different classes.

Gradient Boosting: An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially to correct errors of prior models.

5. Model Evaluation

Models are evaluated using metrics such as:

Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions.

Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Metrics that provide insight into the model's performance, especially in imbalanced datasets.

6. Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameters of the models are tuned using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to find the optimal settings that enhance model performance.

Results

The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy among the tested models, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying South African languages from text data. Further optimization and fine-tuning may yield even better results.
